# Project 1: Aloha Apparel Co. Homepage

This is a single-page website of an online shop, created using HTML5, CSS3, and JQuery. I used a mobile-first approach and then optimized the website for 2 more screen sizes: 600px and 1240px.

## Key points of HTML (things used and personal learnings):
* Used html mark-up to structure the webpage (e.g. tags section, div, nav, header, footer, etc.)
* Used tags script, link

## Key points of CSS:
