# Project 1: Aloha Aloha Apparel Co. Homepage

This is a one-page website of an online shop, created using HTML5, CSS3, and JQuery. I used the mobile-first approach and then optimized the website for 2 more screen sizes: 600px and 1240px. 

## Key points of HTML (things used and personal learnings):
* Used html mark-up to structure the webpage (e.g. tags section, div, nav, header, footer, etc.)
* Used tags script, link

## Key points of CSS:
* Used flexbox properties
* Learned basics of the CSS Grid

## Key points of JS:
* Added an image slider (Flickity Carousel)
* Installed an email address validation into the subscription form
* Added smooth scrolling for the navigation menu
* Implemented an interactive cart filling
